No ‚Äî the MODIFY COLUMN syntax is MySQL only.
For MS SQL Server (MSSQL), the syntax is different.

‚úÖ Steps in MSSQL to change default value:

1Ô∏è‚É£ First, drop the existing default constraint (if any)

In MSSQL, default values are created as constraints, and you must drop the constraint first.

To find the default constraint name:

SELECT name 
FROM sys.default_constraints
WHERE parent_object_id = OBJECT_ID('your_table_name')
  AND parent_column_id = (
        SELECT column_id 
        FROM sys.columns 
        WHERE object_id = OBJECT_ID('your_table_name')
          AND name = 'rating'
     );

You'll get the constraint name (example: DF_products_rating).

Then drop it:

ALTER TABLE your_table_name
DROP CONSTRAINT constraint_name;

2Ô∏è‚É£ Add a new default constraint

ALTER TABLE your_table_name
ADD CONSTRAINT DF_rating_default
DEFAULT 5.0 FOR rating;


---

‚úÖ Full example for table Products

-- Drop old default constraint
ALTER TABLE Products DROP CONSTRAINT DF_Products_Rating;

-- Add new default value
ALTER TABLE Products
ADD CONSTRAINT DF_Rating_Default DEFAULT 5.0 FOR rating;

üìå Important Notes

MSSQL does not allow ALTER COLUMN ... DEFAULT

You must drop the old constraint first

You can name the new constraint anything (DF_Rating_Default here)
